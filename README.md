# Running Code  
1) **Download files** and place in directory
2) **Change Directory in cmd** to reflect where all downloaded files have been placed (here we've named the directory 'Project-2')
    ```
    cd ~/User/Project-2
    ```
3) **Run** and enter both column row pair start and goal locations. If you chose a point inside of a boundary, or coinciding with the start you will be prompted to restart 

4)   ```
           python plot_path.py
           ```
5) **Wait.** As code executes, once the goal position has been reached, the path will be generated
